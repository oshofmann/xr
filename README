A source cross-reference designed to suit my needs better than LXR.

Some nice features:

Takes preprocessed source, making references much less ambiguous.
Especially within the macro-heavy and multiply-implemented arch/
directory.  Downside: you only cross-reference your specific build.

All dynamic features are implemented in javascript, meaning it works
entirely offline, or with a server just serving static pages.

Should deduplicate source pretty well.  Tags less so, due to line numbering
issues.

CIL is currently the source indexer.  It will also translate ctags files,
which is partially used now to index #defines.  CIL is much slower, but
provides any possible fact about the source very easily.  The tree checked
in here contains a 1-line patch to the parser for gcc inline asm, to make
it work correctly for the Linux kernel.

compile cil-1.4.0/, lexer/, tagger/

prepare build environment in gen/build/ and set up gen/make.conf
INPUT_STRIP is the primary variable to modify - this prefix will
be stripped from all source file names. INPUT_PREFIX will be added
to any non-absolute filenames during processing, and stripped
later.

and for the following, -jN is probably a good choice

in gen/
make

in gen/tree/
make -f ../Makefile.deps
make -f ../Makefile.tags
make -f ../Makefile.objs
../dir_listing.sh
