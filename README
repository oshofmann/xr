A source cross-reference designed to suit my needs better than LXR.

Some nice features:

Inline viewing of tags and sources.  Clicking on the tag type character for
an entry brings up an inline source window that should even display the
proper scope.

Takes preprocessed source, making references much less ambiguous.
Especially within the macro-heavy and multiply-implemented arch/
directory.  Downside: you only cross-reference your specific build.

All dynamic features are implemented in javascript, meaning it works
entirely offline, or with a server just serving static pages.

Should deduplicate source pretty well.  Tags less so, due to line numbering
issues.

$XR is this directory.

Set up $XR/gen/xr_config.py. INPUT_BASE is the root of your source, OUTPUT_BASE
should usually be $XR/tree

compile $XR/gen/

Prepare your build environment. Build with CC=path/to/gcc.py

With $XR as your working directory, run gen/post.sh

You can export the results by copying the $XR directory as needed. This command:
rsync -avz -f "- *.ctags" -f "- *.gcc_tags" -f "- gen/pre_tag/*" $SRC_HOST:$XR/* $DEST_DIR
Will exclude the large amount of temporaries.
